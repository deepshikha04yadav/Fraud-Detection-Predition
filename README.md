# Fraud-Detection-Predition

**Fraud-Detection-Predition** is a Python-based project for detecting fraudulent financial transactions. It includes data exploration, model training, and an application interface for making real-time predictions.

## ðŸ“„ Overview

This project demonstrates:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of transaction data.
- Preprocessing and feature engineering to address class imbalance.
- Building and training a machine learning model for binary classification.
- Packaging the trained model and deploying it via a simple interface (`app.py`).

##  Dataset

We use the *Fraud Detection Dataset* from Kaggle, covering various transaction features. Access it here:

###  Preprocessing may include:

- Handling missing values.
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Feature scaling.
- Balancing classes using techniques like SMOTE or undersampling.
